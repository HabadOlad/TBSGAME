    <p>This is the title to fantastic <a href="https://www.misterrogers.org/videos/what-to-you-do-with-the-mad-that-you-feel/" target="_blank"> Mister Rogers song</a>, about kids calming down when they get mad. I feel like it should be used by adults also,
        it teaches that we often lapse into a negative spiral when frustrated, yet according to Fred Rogers, we can turn that into empathy.What’s the first response we have when we're upset with another person? Do we bristle and leap quickly onto defense?
 
         <p>So in my moment of frustration and spiralling anger i thought, turn into around author-of-this-website! And poured my frustration and stress into a text based game. </p>
         <p>I'm pretty sure Mister rogers won't sue me so i have named the game what do you do with the mad you feel?</p>
         <p>It's a text based game in homage to the originals! For more information this is a fantastic documentary called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEJXZ2wnO3w" target="_blank"> Get Lamp: The Text Adventure Documentary</a>.
           Hopefully this game let's you destress, take your mind off things and get empathy rather than anger! DU BIST SCHÖN!</p>
